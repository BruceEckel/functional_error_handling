Code for Bruce Eckel's Pycon2024 Presentation

The associated paper is [here](https://github.com/BruceEckel/functional_error_handling/blob/main/Functional%20Error%20Handling.md).

Works with [rye](https://rye-up.com/). Install rye, clone this repository, and run `rye sync` inside the home directory of the repository.

Test with `rye test` (or `python -m pytest`, but not `pytest`).
